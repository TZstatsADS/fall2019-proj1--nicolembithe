Term: Fall 2019

+ Project title: Most emotive music genres 
+ This project is conducted by Nicole Mbithe

+ Project summary: I decided to delve into the theme of emotiveness in music to see which genres can be considered having the most happy lines as well as the most grim lines. I also checked which songs have the largest range of sentiment, i.e they have a huge difference between the saddest and happiest lines. Basically the ones that are bound to take you on an emotional rollercoaster

The final notebook is stored in the root folder as well since it needs to read from and write to the different folders
